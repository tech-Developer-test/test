  <h1>Privacy Policy for S&M</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 16, 2025 </p>

  <p>S&M (“we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the mobile application S&M (the “App”). This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information provided by users, especially in connection with WhatsApp-based product enquiries.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Seller Phone Numbers</strong>: Collected when sellers submit product listings. This is used to generate WhatsApp order links.</li>
    <li><strong>Product Details</strong>: Name, price, category, and image are stored and shown in the app to facilitate user inquiries.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal data from buyers (e.g., phone numbers or emails).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Seller phone numbers are used to create WhatsApp buttons for product inquiries.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> share seller phone numbers with third parties.</li>
    <li>All WhatsApp messages are sent outside the app, governed by WhatsApp's policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">WhatsApp Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All seller-provided data is stored securely (e.g., via Firebase) and protected from unauthorized access. We do not store or access buyer data.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>
