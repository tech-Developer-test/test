    <h1>🔒 Privacy Policy for Namma Erode</h1>
    <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 9, 2025</p>

    <p>Namma Erode ("we", "our", or "us") operates the mobile application <strong>Namma Erode</strong> (the “App”). This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information provided by users, particularly sellers, especially in connection with WhatsApp-based product inquiries and ordering.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We primarily facilitate a connection between buyers and sellers, and our data collection reflects this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Seller Contact Information (Phone Numbers):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Collected directly from sellers when they submit product listings.</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This number is exclusively used to generate the "Contact Seller on WhatsApp" button/link, enabling buyers to initiate an order or inquiry directly with the seller.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Product Listing Details:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>We collect and store product details, including <strong>Name, Price, Category, Description, and Product Images</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This information is necessary to display the product within the App to facilitate browsing and user inquiries.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note on Buyers' Personal Data:</strong>
        We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, or process any personal data from buyers, such as phone numbers, email addresses, or payment information, as all communication and transactions are directed to WhatsApp.
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Enable Communication:</strong> Seller phone numbers are used <strong>only</strong> to create the functional WhatsApp direct-chat button associated with their respective product listings.</li>
        <li><strong>To Display Products:</strong> Product Details are used to populate the App's catalog and search features.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> share seller phone numbers or any other data with any third parties for marketing or unrelated purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> All direct buyer-seller communication, ordering, and potential payment processing happens <strong>outside</strong> of the Namma Erode App and is governed by the terms and policies of the WhatsApp platform.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App utilizes WhatsApp as the primary external service to enable direct buyer-seller communication and ordering.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>WhatsApp:</strong> When a user clicks the "Contact Seller" button, they are redirected to WhatsApp. Please refer to their own privacy policy for information regarding data usage on their platform: <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">WhatsApp Privacy Policy</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All seller-provided data (including phone numbers and product details) is stored securely (e.g., using services like Firebase) and protected against unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard the information we hold.</li>
        <li>We <strong>do not</strong> store or access any data generated during the communication or transaction process on WhatsApp.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Namma Erode App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>6. Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By submitting product listings and using the Namma Erode App as a seller, you consent to the collection and specific use of your phone number solely for the purpose of WhatsApp integration as described in this policy.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
